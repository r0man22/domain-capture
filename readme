Network Domain Capturer
This script uses the tcpdump tool to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic on your network and extracts the domain names visited during the session.


###Features
Network Traffic Capture: Captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic using the tcpdump tool.
Domain Name Extraction: Extracts domain names from captured traffic.
Flexible Configuration: Users can specify the network interface, target IP, and output file names.
File Management: The domain file can be preserved or deleted based on user preference.

###Usage

./domain_capturer.sh [options]


####Options
-i INTERFACE
Specify the network interface to capture traffic from. Default: any.

-t TARGET_IP
Filters traffic for a specific IP address. If not specified, all traffic is captured.

-r RESULT_FILE
Specify the file to save tcpdump output. Default: result.txt.

-d DOMAIN_FILE
Specify the file to save extracted domain names. Default: domains.txt.

-k
Prevents the script from deleting the domain file (domains.txt) after the script finishes. By default, this file is deleted.


###Examples
Run with default settings (capture all traffic):
./domain_capturer.sh


Capture traffic on a specific network interface (e.g., eth0):
./domain_capturer.sh -i eth0


Capture traffic for a specific IP address:
./domain_capturer.sh -t 192.168.1.100


Save output to custom files:
./domain_capturer.sh -r custom_output.txt -d custom_domains.txt


Preserve the domain file (it is deleted by default):
./domain_capturer.sh -k


###Requirements
tcpdump: Required for capturing network traffic. Must be installed on the system before running the script.
awk and grep: Linux tools used for text processing.


###Permissions
Make the script executable before running:

chmod +x domain_capturer.sh


###How It Works
Traffic Capture: The script captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic on the specified network interface (any by default).
Domain Extraction: Domain names are extracted from the tcpdump output.
Results: The extracted domain names are saved to a specified file. The user presses any key when the script finishes to view the results.
File Management: By default, temporary files (result.txt and domains.txt) are deleted after the script finishes. The -k option allows the domain file to be preserved.
Notes
The script may require elevated privileges (sudo) to run tcpdump properly.
Temporary files are deleted by default. The domain file can be preserved using the -k option.
